In this project we were tasked with adding the new component of movie details and all of the functionality that comes with it.

I solved this problem by breaking it down into many differant smaller problems:
[ ] Create movie list component
[ ] import component to App
[ ] set up router
[ ] Set up routes from each page for navigation
[ ] Use useEffect and useDispatch to get data for the movies from server
[ ] Use Store to get all the movies from the store
[ ] use useParams to target the ID of the movie clicked
[ ] find where the movie ID is = to the movie ID in the Database
[ ] display the data to the dom on the movie detials page
[ ] use useHistory to make the back to movies button work
[ ] Styled the Movie list used some hover effects
[ ] Styled the movie description
